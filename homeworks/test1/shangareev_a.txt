Which assumptions are made for causal discovery?


Assumption 1 (Causal Sufficiency). There are no hidden confounders, and all the random variables of interest are observable.
Assumption 2 (Finite Samples). There is a finite number of observational/interventional samples available.
Assumption 3 (Nonlinear SCM with Additive Noise). The structural causal model has nonlinear conditional expectations with additive Gaussian noise.
Assumption 4 (Single Target). Each intervention is atomic and applied to a single target of the SCM


How does causal bayesian network and structural causal model relate to each other?


A SCM matches a set of equations which are representing the conditional distributions in a Causal Bayesian Network.


In which way mutual information is used in the algorithm design?


As I understood, the more MI the better. We improve our DAG by maximizing it (loss functions in ML is a good analogy).


Explain in simple words what is structural causal model.


SCM is a graphical model (DAG) where each node is a variable in U or V and each edge is a function that determines the values of the variables in V based on the values of the variables in U.


How can one interpret weights on the edges of the graph?


Weights in the edges of graphs represent the strength of the variable’s relationships. It can be positive and negative (just like the correlation).


What are the advantages of proposed algorithms compared to related works?


It’s compared to ABCD and AIT, citations:
ABCD (Agrawal et al., 2019). “Soft-CBED is a faster and more efficient batch strategy, especially when values also have to be acquired. From this perspective, our approach is an extension of ABCD with nonlinear assumptions, value acquisition, and a soft top-k batching strategy.”
AIT (Scherrer et al., 2021). “AIT does not select intervention values like ABCD and does not have a batch strategy.”
