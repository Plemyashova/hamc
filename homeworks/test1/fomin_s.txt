1. Which assumptions are made for causal discovery?
Assumption 1 (Causal Sufficiency): There are no hidden confounders, and all the random variables of interest are observable. Assumption 2
(Finite Samples): There is a finite number of observational/interventional samples available. Assumption 3 (Nonlinear SCM with Additive Noise):
The structural causal model has nonlinear conditional expectations with additive Gaussian noise. Assumption 4 (Single Target): Each
intervention is atomic and applied to a single target of the SCM

2. How does causal bayesian network and structural causal model relate to each other?
A specific type of structural causal model is a causal Bayesian network, which displays the causal connections between variables as a directed
acyclic graph. The set of equations in an SCM represents conditional distributions in a causal Bayesian network.

3. In which way mutual information is used in the algorithm design?
Mutual information is employed in the algorithm's design to assess the strength of links between variables and to identify potential edges for
constructing the causal graph. A higher mutual information implies a better outcome, and the DAG is improved by maximizing it, similar to loss
functions in ML.

4. Explain in simple words what is structural causal model.
A structural causal model is a mathematical model that specifies how the variables in a system are causally interconnected. Each variable's
value is determined by its immediate causes and an independent noise variable. The SCM is a graphical model represented as a DAG, where
each node is a variable in U or V, and each edge determines V's values based on the values in U.

5. How can one interpret weights on the edges of the graph?
The edges' weights represent the causal relationships' strength and direction among the variables. Positive weights denote positive influences,
while negative weights indicate negative impacts.

6. What are the advantages of proposed algorithms compared to related works?
The proposed algorithms have several advantages, including their ability to handle nonlinear relationships, identify latent variables, and
incorporate previous knowledge about causal links. Compared to existing state-of-the-art methods, they also have higher efficiency and
accuracy.
